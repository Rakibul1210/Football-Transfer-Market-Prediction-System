# Football Transfer Market Prediction System

## Overview

Welcome to our Football Transfer Market Prediction System project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing a predictive system that estimates the market price of football players for the upcoming season based on their past performance. This project is a collaborative effort by Rakibul Islam (bsse1210@iit.du.ac.bd), Sazzad Hossain (bsse1207@iit.du.ac.bd), and Md. Yasir Arafat Araf (bsse1220@iit.du.ac.bd).

## Description

The Football Transfer Market Prediction System is an ambitious project aimed at predicting the market values of football players. This system leverages data analysis techniques to identify key factors contributing to a player's market value and builds a prediction model to forecast their value for the next season. By combining elements of data science, machine learning, and sports analytics, we strive to provide valuable insights to football enthusiasts, analysts, and clubs.

## Features

- Data collection from various sources, including player statistics and transfer data
- Machine learning models for predicting transfer values
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for accurate predictions
- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- A easy to use user iinterface
- Collaboration through a Git repository
